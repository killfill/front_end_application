# Hello!

>Thanks for your interest in joining the Lucera Team!  I'll get you caught up on what we do, what we want to do and what we expect from members of our team.

At it's core, Lucera is a technological research and development lab.  We have our hands in custom hardware, low-latency and high-throughput cloud technology, software defined networking with dedicated fiber and more.  Our infrastructure is continually updated so we are always on the bleeding edge of performance. 

Sitting on top of this infrastructure is our flagship application, LumeFX.  LumeFX is the first distributed exchange model running in production.  It's smart order routing and aggregation allows you to put operation on autopilot and maximize fill. 

# Beyond!

>The possibilities are endless.  We have the fasted cloud on planet earth at our disposal.  Next we `./build`!

LumeFX has proven to be a successful model.  It utilizes the beautifully simplistic complexity of our infrastructure and continues to deliver optimal service to many clients.  It's an easy sell.  However, licensing the infrastructure itself is a lot more difficult than licensing an application running on said infrastructure.  Solution? Unicorns.

noun

1. a mythical animal typically represented as a horse with a single straight horn projecting from its forehead.
2. an exceptional javascript developer (back and front end) with a strong eye for good design, user experience and design patterns.

The front end team at Lucera is looking for unicorns to help in the development advanced cloud management tools, fast and modern user interfaces for financial applications and to brainstorm with us about the future of Lucera!

We are excited to see what you have to bring to the table. The next page outlines the criteria for the test.  Try not to spend too much time in one area (front or backend).  Convince us you are a unicorn and deliver a stable balanced product. small product If you have any questions feel free to email us at [rl@lucerahq.com](mailto:rl@lucerahq.com), but keep in mind that this is also a test of your ability to problem solve, think, and execute independently.  Everything you need is outlined below.

# Lucera Front End Engineer Test
> Test Duration: 1 Week

## Objective

Build an application to visualize stock data from [dev.markitondemand.com](http://dev.markitondemand.com/#stockquote).  Make your application realtime by polling the API from the server and pushing the data over socket.io.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](nodejs.org) (server)
- [Express.js](expressjs.com) (framework)
- [Socket.io](socket.io) (sockets)
- [Flux](facebook.github.io/react/docs/flux-overview.html) Archetecture (design pattern)
- [React.js](facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html) (views)
- [Require.js](requirejs.org/) (AMD)
- [Bower](bower.io) (client side dependency manager)

This is very much a test of your ability to problem solve indpendently. Any questions can be directed to [rl@lucerahq.com](mailto:rl@lucerahq.com), but no further guidance will be given.  All the information you need is provided for you in the links above.

## Delivery
First, fork this repository.  In your fork create a directory called `app`. Add your resume to the repo's root and write your application in the app directory. Keep your git commits clean and use feature branches.  Your git proficiency will be evaluated. You will have one week from the time your code is forked.

#### Good Luck!
